1.Create Predictive-Book-Analysis-Rating
A predictive Book Analysis rating system in SQL. It contains my own data from Goodreads to analyze how my book ratings differ from the average ratings found on Goodreads. The books are categorized by genre and obtains the average difference in rating per genre. Another table is created containing similar data for books that won the Booker Prize for Fiction from 2000-2021 and joined this data to predict, for each Booker Prize-winning book, what my rating would be.
